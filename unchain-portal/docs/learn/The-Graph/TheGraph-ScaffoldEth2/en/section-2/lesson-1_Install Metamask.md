## Install Metamask

### Install MetaMask

When we deploy a smart contract to the blockchain or interact with a deployed smart contract, we need to pay for gas. Therefore, we need a Web3 wallet, such as MetaMask. Click here to install MetaMask.[here](https://metamask.io/)

You will also want to get some testnet ETH, so that you can deploy your contract to a testnet later in this tutorial.
