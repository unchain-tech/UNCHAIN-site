### ✅ YOLO Vercel!

Last step is to push our frontend to vercel! This is easy with the following command, which essential skips build errors with the following command line switches 'vercel --build-env NEXT_PUBLIC_IGNORE_BUILD_ERROR=true'

This might take some time, so grab a coffee. ☕

```
yarn vercel:yolo
```

You should see the following prompts.

```
