## Deploy

### âœ… Create and ship our Subgraph

Now we can open up a fourth window to finish setting up The Graph. ðŸ˜… In this forth window we will create our local subgraph!

> Note: You will only need to do this once.

```
yarn local-create
```

![](./../../img/section-0/0_5_1.png)

> You should see some output stating your Subgraph has been created along with a log output on your graph-node inside docker.

Next we will ship our subgraph! You will need to give your subgraph a version after executing this command. (e.g. 0.0.1).

```
yarn local-ship
```

![](./../../img/section-0/0_5_2.png)

> This command does the following all in oneâ€¦ ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

- Copies the contracts ABI from the hardhat/deployments folder
- Generates the networks.json file
- Generates AssemblyScript types from the subgraph schema and the contract ABIs.
- Compiles and checks the mapping functions.
- â€¦ and deploy a local subgraph!

> If you get an error ts-node you can install it with the following command

```
npm install -g ts-node
```

If your subgraph deployment was successful it will look something like this:

You should get a build completed output along with the address of your Subgraph endpoint.
