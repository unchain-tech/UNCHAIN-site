### 🎉 Course Introduction

This workshop is built around Scaffold-ETH 2 and The Graph. You will learn how to:

1. Setup a development environment for your dapp using Scaffold-ETH 2 and The Graph
2. Update and deploy your smart contract
3. Create and deploy a Subgraph to The Graph
4. Edit your frontend to interact with both your smart contract and Subgraph

### 🏗 What is Scaffold-ETH 2 🏗

🧪 An open-source, up-to-date toolkit for building decentralized applications (dapps) on the Ethereum blockchain. It's designed to make it easier for developers to create and deploy smart contracts and build user interfaces that interact with those contracts.

⚙️ Built using NextJS, RainbowKit, Hardhat, Wagmi, and Typescript.

- ✅ **Contract Hot Reload**: Your frontend auto-adapts to your smart contract as you edit it.
- 🔥 **Burner Wallet & Local Faucet**: Quickly test your application with a burner wallet and local faucet.
- 🔐 **Integration with Wallet Providers**: Connect to different wallet providers and interact with the Ethereum network.

### 🧑🏼‍🚀 What is The Graph?

[The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) is a protocol for building decentralized applications (dApps) quickly on Ethereum and IPFS using GraphQL.

- 🗃️ **Decentralized Indexing**: The Graph enables open APIs ("subgraphs") to efficiently index and organize blockchain data.
- 🔎 **Efficient Querying**: The protocol uses GraphQL for streamlined querying blockchain data.
- 🙌 **Community Ecosystem**: The Graph fosters collaboration by empowering developers to build, deploy, and share subgraphs!

For detailed instructions and more context, check out the [Getting Started Guide](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/cookbook/quick-start).

### 🧱 What we are building

We are building an example smart contract and front end that utilizes The Graph protocol for data storage of event data.
