‚ö†Ô∏è It may take a few minutes before you can access the site from your browser. If you receive an error message similar to the one below, please wait a few minutes and try accessing the site again.

If you have access to the application, start by clicking "connect" to link your Metamask account (make sure it's whitelisted).

After successfully minting, if you are the owner, you can click "withdraw" to retrieve the tokens from the contract.

Alright, it's time to check out the NFT Collection you've created on OpenSea. Enter the following URL in your browser: `https://testnets.opensea.io/assets/mumbai/0x86b5cf393100cf895b3371a4ccaa1bc95d486a56/1`. Replace "`0x86b5cf393100cf895b3371a4ccaa1bc95d486a56`" with your contract address, and you'll be able to see the first NFT in your Collection.

### üõ† Final step, configure the Collection.

If you're the owner, there might be a few additional steps you need to complete. These steps can enhance the appearance of your collection and potentially increase your earnings.

Using the owner account, open the collection page and follow the steps to click on "Edit collection".

One particularly interesting aspect is the "Creator Earnings." Every time a user sells an item from your collection on OpenSea, you can earn a certain percentage of the sale price.
